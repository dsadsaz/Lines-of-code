# Lines-of-code


In this program my objective was to count the number of lines (excluding blank lines and comments) in a Python file specified in the command-line arguments.

So with this script I understood the basic of argvs and Python file I/O


I've decided to include this script in my portfolio just as an example of the many little exercises I've done using Python since I started.
